# Ensuring-File-Integrity-on-Windows-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-Using-CertUtil
This script demonstrates how to verify the integrity of a file on Windows using the certutil command to generate SHA-256 hashes. The process begins by creating an initial hash of the file "PhD info.txt" to establish a baseline: certutil -hashfile "PhD info.txt" SHA256. Next, the file is modified (for example, by editing its contents or metadata). After modification, a new hash is generated to compare against the original: certutil -hashfile "PhD info.txt" SHA256. Finally, the file is reverted to its original state, and the hash is generated again to confirm it matches the initial hash: certutil -hashfile "PhD info.txt" SHA256. This method is useful for detecting unauthorized modifications and ensuring data integrity. The script can be run directly in the Command Prompt, providing a practical example of file integrity verification using built-in Windows tools.
